A self-study project designed to implement a parking management system, showcasing modern backend development practices. This API provides a solution for managing parking operations, built with the following technologies:

Spring Boot 3: Core framework for building the application.
Spring Security: Authentication and authorization with secure access control.
JWT Tokens: Stateless authentication mechanism for API security.
End-to-End Testing: Comprehensive testing to ensure reliability.
Spring Data JPA: Simplified database operations with ORM.
OpenAPI and Swagger: Interactive API documentation and exploration.
DTO and ModelMapper: Efficient data transfer and object mapping.
Jakarta Bean Validation: Input validation for data integrity.
Spring JPA Auditing: Automatic tracking of entity changes.
JasperReports: Report generation for parking data insights.

This project serves as a practical learning exercise to deepen my understanding of Spring ecosystem tools and best practices in API development.
